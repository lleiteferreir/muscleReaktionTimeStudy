# Reaction Test for Muscles with Feedback - Unity Project
This Unity project contains a reaction test program designed to measure the response time of muscles. The test utilizes three different types of feedback mechanisms: Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS), Vibration, and Visual cues. The purpose of this test is to assess the user's reaction time and muscle responsiveness in different feedback scenarios.

## Features
Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS): This feature allows the program to send controlled electrical impulses to specific muscles, eliciting involuntary contractions and testing the user's response time to the stimulus.

Vibration Feedback: The program incorporates vibration as a feedback mechanism to simulate real-world scenarios where vibrations can serve as a cue for a quick muscle response. This feature assesses the user's ability to react promptly to vibrating stimuli.

Visual Cues: The test also includes visual cues in the form of on-screen prompts, such as flashing lights or changing colors. This component evaluates the user's reaction time based on visual stimulation.

Customizable Parameters: The program provides adjustable parameters to customize the test according to specific requirements. These parameters include stimulus intensity, duration, frequency, and intervals between stimuli.

Performance Metrics: The code tracks and records various performance metrics, such as response time, accuracy, and muscle activation levels, with a biopluxsginals device. These metrics can be analyzed to assess the user's reaction capabilities and improvements over time.

## Prerequisites
To run the reaction test code in Unity, you need to have the following:

Unity Game Engine: Make sure you have Unity installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Unity from the Unity website.

Unity Project Setup: Set up a new Unity project or open an existing project where you want to integrate the reaction test code.
